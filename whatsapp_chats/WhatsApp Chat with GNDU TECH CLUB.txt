Did something happened? 💀🧃
14/09/25, 5:54 pm - Jashanpreet Singh Dingra GNDU: I'm excited to share a major milestone from my recent experience as a Visiting Research Student at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA)! 🔭
Under the guidance of Prof. Gulab Chand Dewangan (Senior Professor, IUCAA), I developed a custom Python pipeline called vdisp_fit. While the original project focused on measuring the stellar velocity dispersion (σ) for Seyfert Type 1 galaxies, I extended the pipeline to work for all types of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using high-resolution stellar templates from the MILES library.
Stellar velocity dispersion is a fundamental parameter in galaxy dynamics, offering crucial insights into a galaxy's mass, formation history, and evolution. My pipeline leverages a direct spectral fitting technique that separates non-linear broadening from linear components, ensuring robust and stable fits. Initial tests on 499 SDSS galaxies show promising results, demonstrating the pipeline’s capability for automated kinematic analysis across diverse galaxy types.
This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply theoretical concepts in astrophysics to a real-world computational problem.
Check out the full report and code on GitHub: https://github.com/jsdingra11/vdisp_fit/
If you find it interesting, I’d really appreciate it if you could star the repository! ⭐

26/10/25, 11:26 pm - Meta AI: MUN stands for Model United Nations 😊. It's like a simulation of the UN where students debate global issues, just like real diplomats! You get to be a delegate, represent a country, and discuss some pretty important stuff 🌎. It's a great way to learn about international relations, public speaking, and teamwork 🤝. Many schools and colleges in India participate in MUN conferences, both local and international 📚.

💬 FAQ Section

1. *What is a Model United Nations (MUN)?* 

A Model UN is a simulation of the United Nations where students represent different countries and discuss international issues through diplomacy, debate, and negotiation. It helps enhance leadership, research, and public-speaking skills.


2. *Who can participate?* 
Students from any department or institution are welcome to participate. MUN is open to both GNDU students and external participants.


3. *What if I don’t know how an MUN works?* 
No worries! An online orientation session will be held before the event to explain everything — from the format, rules, and dress code to how debates and caucuses work.


4. *Can I participate with a friend?* 
Yes. You may form a team of two delegates representing one country. However, both delegates must register individually and later inform the coordinators about their team formation.


5. *What does “Hybrid Delegation” mean?* 
It means that while some countries will have single delegates, others may have two, depending on the complexity of representation and registration volume.


6. *What is the mode of payment?* 
Prepayment is mandatory. Details will be shared along with the form link. A payment screenshot must be uploaded in the registration form.

All delegates will receive a participation kit, official certificate, and refreshments or meals (based on the selected fee tier). The experience and certificate are valuable additions to your CV and portfolio.

After registration and payment confirmation, countries will be assigned based on availability and diversity of representation.

A Model UN is a simulation of the United Nations where students represent different countries and discuss international issues through diplomacy, debate, and negotiation. It helps enhance leadership, research, and public-speaking skills.

No worries! An online orientation session will be held before the event to explain everything — from the format, rules, and dress code to how debates and caucuses work.

Yes. You may form a team of two delegates representing one country. However, both delegates must register individually and later inform the coordinators about their team formation.

It means that while some countries will have single delegates, others may have two, depending on the complexity of representation and registration volume.
